CS 3550 Assignment 2 (Layout)
=============================

**Status**: Draft \
**Due**: Phase 1 due **5 Sep**. Phase 2--5 due **12 Sep**.

In this assignment, you will use flex-box to set up the layout of our
"Dishbook" application and ensure that the layout adjusts correctly to
screens and devices of various sizes. Specifically you will:

- Set up a simple centered page layout
- Establish proper whitespace between page elements
- Lay out cards and metadata rows
- Ensure that the layout is responsive and works on mobile

The assignment is due Friday, 5 September, before midnight. The
course's normal extension policy applies. Hand in your finished
assignment by pushing it to your repository on Github.

This assignment is intended take 6--8 hours and must be done solo. If
you get stuck for more than an hour or so, get help on Piazza or sign
up for an office hours slot.

All code you turn in must be yours. You cannot copying code from
sources on the internet, *including source code from live websites* or
generated by AI tools. You may discuss, plan, and confer with your
peers about how to do this assignment, or ask their help debugging
your code. However, any peers you do confer with must be listed on the
assignment cover sheet.

Phase 1: Adding a CSS Reset
---------------------------

Add the following line to your `main.css` file:

    * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }

Start your server, go to http://localhost:8000/static/main.css, and
make sure you see this line. If you don't, try to hard-refresh by
pressing Ctrl+Shift+R in your browser. This asks the browser to
refresh without using its cache. You'll want to get in the habit of
doing this when you're working on CSS.

Once you see this line, go back to your index page at
http://localhost:8000/static/index.html; it should look different and
a bit uglier: all of the text should be smooshed together and there
should be less whitespace. That's OK: the default margins might look
better than no margins, but the CSS reset gives us a blank slate to
start with which will make layout less confusing.

Go to each of your HTML pages and add the following line somewhere
near the top. (Ideally it should go after the `<meta charset="utf-8">`
line but before anything else.)

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

This tells the browser that our web page supports mobile layout. It
doesn't yet, but it will! Commit everything to Github; Phase 1 is
done once you pass the auto-tester.



General goals
-------------

Our goal in this homework assignment is to add CSS to the page to
match the following screenshots:

<div style="display:flex;align-items:start">
<img src="hw2/index.png" alt="A screenshot of the home page" width=19% />
<img src="hw2/recipe.png" alt="A screenshot of the recipe page" width=19% />
<img src="hw2/search.png" alt="A screenshot of the search page" width=19% />
<img src="hw2/profile.png" alt="A screenshot of the profile page" width=19% />
<img src="hw2/login.png" alt="A screenshot of the login page" width=19% />
</div>

To do so, you will largely use flexbox layout, in particular the
following properties:

- `display`, specifically the `flex` value, and `flex-direction`
- `width`, `height`, and `gap`
- `justify-content` and `align-items`
- `flex-wrap` and `text-wrap`
- `padding` and, optionally, `margin`
- `text-indent` when directed

You may also want to use `calc` in various places to simplify
implementation.



Phase 2: Centering the web page body
------------------------------------

Write CSS to center all of the page content. Use flex-box. You may
want to apply CSS to the `html` and `body` elements.

Make sure that the page content is at most `700px` wide; this will
make body text about 80 characters wide, which is about as wide as you
want to go.

Test each web page at various sizes. At more than 700 pixels wide, the
page content should be 700 pixels wide and centered on the page. At
narrower browser window sizes, the page content should be as wide as
the screen and text should wrap so it's all still readable. (At some
point individual words will start poking out the side of the screen;
don't worry about this yet.)



Phase 3: Headers, tags, sidebars, cards
---------------------------------------

Next, lay out the page header. The page header should consist of two
rows; the top row should contain the "Dishbook" title and the "View
profile" links, while the second row should contain the "Home" and "My
Cookbook" links as well as the search form. Test that the profile
information and search form stay right-aligned as the page resizes.

On the recipe page, set up the layout where the photo/metadata is
side-by-side with the recipe description and the ingredients are
side-by-side with the recipe steps. Don't change the source order of
the page---the HTML should still contain metadata, description,
ingredients, and steps in that order. You may need to add two `div`
elements. In each pair of side-by-side elements, have a `1rem` gap
between them and then split the remaining space 1:2 (meaning the
left sidebar is a third of the remaining width and the right side is
two thirds of the remaining width). There are a number of ways to
achieve this; you could either use `width` together with `flex-grow`
and `flex-shrink`, or you could use `width` with `calc` values. Either
way is fine. Make sure the two sidebar pairs line up on the screen
even as you resize the screen.

Now focus on the header at the top of the recipe page.




Phase 4: Card layouts
---------------------

The Dishbook website will use two main fonts:

- `Nunito`, a friendly, rounded, sans-serif font for body text
- `Playwrite USA Traditional`, a cursive font for headings

These fonts give Dishbook a friendly, cozy, hand-made feeling. Find
both fonts on Google Fonts. Get the "embed code" for them; on the
"embed code" page configure Nunito to include both italic and roman at
all weights, but for Playwrite USA Traditional only include 400
weight. By selecting only the parts of a font we need, we reduce
download size and make our web page faster to load. Add the HTML embed
code provided by Google Fonts to the beginning of each HTML page.

Create a `main.css` file in your `static/` folder, and `<link>` to it
from every HTML file. You'll be adding CSS code to this file to make
the Dishbook web page look more like the screenshot.

First, set all headings to use the Playwrite USA Traditional font; in
CSS, this font is called `Playwrite US Trad`. Set all other text to
use the Nunito font. Make sure to add appropriate fallback fonts.

Set the size of all body text on the page to 18 pixels. Set the size
of headings to 25% larger than that, except for the main title (like
the recipe name), which should be 80% larger. On the login page, set
the text inside the login form (including text entries, labels, and
buttons) to be 25% larger than the default.

Bold the appropriate text. For the "Prep time" and similar text, set
the weight to 600, which is a little less bold than "bold".

Set the `line-height` of the ingredients, steps, and description to
1.25. Don't change the line height of other text on the page, like the
headings, they'll get too spaced out.



Phase 5: Responsive layout
--------------------------

The page uses just a couple colors: #F7F1E8 "cream", #2E261C "cast
iron", #A8570C "cacao", #FFF9F1 "paper", #888 "ash", #8B5E34 "oak",
and in a few places #FFF pure white. Note that these aren't the
standard names for these colors, just thematically appropriate names
chosen to help you remember which is which.

Assign the appropriate text color to body text, links ("oak" normally
and "cacao" on hover), and headings. Also use the appropriate color
for the hash signs in the list of tags. Links should be underlined
*only* on hover.

On the main page, make the "Create and account" and "Browse recipes"
links look like buttons. Make the background / foreground colors cream
and oak (on hover, cacao and paper). Assign `padding: .5em 1em` to
make the button itself a bit bigger, and round the corners into a
"pill" shape.

On the recipe page, rotate the photo by 2 degrees. You can do that by
assigning `transform: rotate(2deg)`. It helps the page look a bit more
casual, as if it's a paper cookbook that you pasted a photo into.
Also, give the photo a five-pixel white border with a three-pixel
corner radius; this makes it look a little bit like a polaroid photo,
heightening the effect.

Assign the appropriate background the to the page as a whole and also
the main portion of the page where the page-specific content is.

Finally, assign the appropriate borders to the main portion of the
page, in the heading, and on the login page. Match the width and color
of each border.

Hide the bullet points for the list of tags and ingredients, and in
the nav bar, and for recipes on the home / search / profile pages.
Keep the numbers for the list of steps.

Some other elements on the page should also be hidden, most
importantly `<label>`s and buttons for the search bar (both in the
page header and on the search page). Give these elements a class of
`visually-hidden` and assign these elements `display: none`.


Write a cover sheet
-------------------

Rerun `python3 manage.py runserver` and confirm that every page looks
as expected. Also confirm that all of the links work and that all of
the HTML source code is readable. If you find any problems, use the
browser developer tools or an HTML validator to understand and correct
the problem.

Once you are sure everything works correctly, copy-and-paste the
following text into a new empty text file called "HW1.md" located
directly in your repository (not in the `static/` folder):

```

In the first list, replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for each phase of the
assignment you completed.

In the second list, replace the `...`s with the names of all other
persons (student, friend, family, online stranger) that you discussed
this assignment with.

In the oath below that, check the box. Recall that, while you may
discuss the assignment in broad strokes, you must write every line of
code submitted by you, as stated in the oath below this list. This
includes the use of AI tools such as ChatGPT.

In the last two paragraphs, replace the `...` with the most
interesting and the most difficult aspect of this assignment. Don't
just make them a few words; write in full sentences. The instructors
use your answers to make these assignments more interesting and
easier.



How you will use this
---------------------

HTML and CSS are the core front-end technologies. Everything you see
on every web page, all across the web, comes back to these two
technologies, and they're also typically the starting point for making
a new website: establishing the right HTML structure and applying
basic styles with CSS.

In [Assignment 2](hw2.md) we'll go further to establish the layout of
the web page and make sure the page works on mobile devices. In most
web pages, that's a critical requirement. Then, in [Assignment
3](hw3.md), we'll start generating the HTML programmatically, based on
data in a database. For example, each step in a recipe will be one
iteration of a `for` loop. That's how most web sites generate HTML.

Writing valid, semantic HTML is important because it helps with
styling, search engine results, and accessibility. For example, `alt`
text helps search engines find pages with relevant images. And it also
helps blind people who use screen readers. (And if that's not you,
now, consider that things may change as you get older.)



Grading Rubric
--------------

This assignment is worth 100 points. The different phases are worth
different weights:

**Phase 1** is worth 5 points. It is graded on:

- Your repository must contain a CSS Reset in its `main.css` file
- Each page must have the `<meta name=viewport>` tag.
  
If you pass all auto-tests up to and including "Checking that
`/static/profile.html` has a `<meta name=viewport>`", then you have
completed this phase.

**Phase 2** is worth 10 points. It is graded on:

- Page content is centered on all pages
- Flex-box used to do so
- Text wraps and no scrollbars appear below 700 pixels wide

**Phase 3** is worth 15 points. It is graded on:

- All of the required content must be present.
- All links and images on the page work
- Appropriate HTML tags and attributes are used for each part of the page.
- The page header is identical to other pages and all recipes card
  use identical structure.

**Phase 4** is worth 20 points. Is is graded on:

- The page must include the correct fonts and link to a `main.css` file
- The correct font must be used for all elements
- The correct font size and weight must be used for all elements
- The correct line height must be used for all elements

**Phase 5** is worth 20 points. It is graded on:

- All text must have the appropriate color
- All backgrounds must be the appropriate color
- All borders must be the appropriate colors, thicknesses, and radii
- Tags and ingredients must not have bullet points, but steps should
  still be numbered.

**Cover Sheet** is worth 5 points. It is graded on:

- Cover sheet is formatted correctly.
- All questions on the cover sheet have coherent answers.

Note that if your cover sheet does not list all people you discussed
the assignment with, or misrepresents others' work as your own, that
is academic misconduct and can result in severe sanctions beyond the 5
points the cover sheet is worth. In the most severe cases, the
sanction for academic misconduct is failing this course.
