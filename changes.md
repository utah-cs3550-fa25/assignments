Changes from Fall 2024
======================

This document isn't really intended for students, but it might be
interesting to read anyway, and it's convenient for the instructors to
have it in this repository.

- The course project is entirely redone; it's now a recipe site. It
  should look better (nice photos of food?), be more fun (easy to
  pre-fill lots of recipes), and has less of a "school assignment"
  vibe.
- I've added/kept in-class quizzes.
- I've de-emphasized writing HTML, on the grounds that LLMs find this
  really easy. The study guide instead emphasizes reading and
  debugging HTML. The first assignment loses some of the HTML writing
  in favor of HTML debugging and accessibility. HTML and basic CSS is
  further integrated in lectures.
- Flex-box is extended to four lectures, with a clear progression of
  single flex container, then nested flex containers, and then finally
  responsive design. Legacy layout is dropped entirely, in favor of a
  CSS reset. Media queries are explicitly required.
- I've also de-emphasized the Django template language and the Django
  model types. I've increased emphasis on foreign key relationships,
  migrations, and structured view data. I'll try to emphasize lazy
  evaluation of queries, too.
